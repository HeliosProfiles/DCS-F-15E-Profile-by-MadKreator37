# Script to make adjustments to the Helios profile by adding in
# additional items by XML manipulation.  This should be more
# reliable than using diff-match-patch.
# There are still changes to be made after this script, but it is more
# efficient for these to be text substitutions.  These changes are not 
# committed.
# Arguments:
# 1. Filename for the original Helios Profile file
# 2. Filename for the Bindings XML to be inserted into the profile 
# 3. Filename of the resultant Helios profile
