# DCS F-15E Helios Profile by MadKreator37 
## Download the Profile helios16 package from [the __Assets__ section here](https://github.com/HeliosProfiles/DCS-F-15E-Profile-by-MadKreator37/releases/latest)
This is a Helios profile for [Razbam's F-15E Strike Eagle Module for DCS](https://www.razbamsimulationsllc.com/f-15e-strike-eagle) designed for DCS World and contributed by @MadKreator37 . 
This profile utilises an aircraft specifc interface which was written into the Helios Virtual Cockpit project called **Helios**.  This can be downloaded from [Helios latest release](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest)
In addition to the profile, the MFDs can have their viewports exported using patches provided by Helios.

### ABOUT
This profile was designed and created by myself, in close collaboration with BlueFin. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the F-15 cockpit, texture files or replicas were designed and created from scratch by BlueFin. Every piece used is specific to the F-15E.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for RAZBAM'S F-15E for DCS that we could. This profile includes *BOTH* Pilot and WSO seats all in one shot. Seat position in the profile, and in the game, will switch simultaneously as well as the viewports. This will allow you to use both seats as a single player, or pick whichever one you want to play in MP with the push of a button. There are several added functions in the profile, such as buttons for the F-10 map, rearm/refuel window, briefing menu etc. 

*NOTE*: The added functions: F1, F10, F6, Esc, Rearm, Briefing and Kneeboard as well as the functioning ejection seat handles,  require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these then some functions may not work as intended.

### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc.(highly recommended anyway). It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple displays, and types,  to rule out any "game breaking" visuals but it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.

-*Remember to always make a back up of files before making changes*
